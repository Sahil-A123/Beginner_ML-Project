# Beginner_ML-Project
I a build a beginner machine learning project. This includes creating a hypothesis, setting up the model, and measuring error. By the end, of this project you'll see how to use an end-to-end machine learning project using Python and Jupyter.

To make this interesting, I use a fun dataset. I use data from historical Olympic games. In this I will try to predict how many medals a country will win based on historical and current data.
